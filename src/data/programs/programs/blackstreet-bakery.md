## **The Consequences of Displacement**

North and Northeast Portland is considered the historic heart of Portland’s Black community. Originally, Black Portlanders were involuntarily forced to live in North/Northeast Portland due to Oregon’s culture of racism. However, a self-supporting Black community eventually flourished; culturally specific schools, churches, small businesses, and community centers provided resources that Black Portlanders could not access elsewhere.

After decades of public disinvestment, the 1970s marked the beginning of urban renewal and gentrification, which to this day continues to displace Black Portlanders away from the City core and into areas with fewer equitable opportunities and a loss of the geographically cohesive community as they developed for survival.

Black Portlanders need and deserve the reconstruction of the social cohesion that once existed in North and Northeast Portland, the revitalization of economic opportunities that build multigenerational wealth, and for Portlanders of all backgrounds to reinforce our neighbors’ contributions to the community.

## **Regenerative Economics**

Blackstreet Bakery is committed to working with the community to reverse the impacts of gentrification and displacement through the concept of regenerative economics. Blackstreet Bakery was created in 2018 to serve as a jobs program that provides extensive training, creates good jobs, and combats poverty for Black Portlanders through plant-based baking.

Blackstreet Bakery conducts outreach to Black Portlanders of all skill levels and professional backgrounds to provide job training and employment with livable entry wages. In addition to this training, we invest in wraparound supports especially tailored to the Black Portlanders we serve.

We educate participants on local Black history to help rally and inspire our team around the vision of owning a non-profit cafe space to provide a long-term home for Blackstreet Bakery in North and Northeast Portland.
