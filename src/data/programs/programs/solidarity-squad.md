- quote: We all have healing to do. And when we do heal, we will recognize what we’ve
    known, deep down, all along. We are beautiful, we are strong, and we are worthy.
    The fires of our lives make the perfect place for a phoenix to emerge, and fly.”

Our team works to address the needs of our community through means other than direct financial support. We manage incoming requests, connect folks with outside resources, match donations with needs, and coordinate pickup and delivery of in-kind donations. We connect volunteers providing services such as yard work or car repair with folks in our community. The Solidarity Squad network has proven that solutions for the community can come from within the community. Even in the hardest of times, we can work together to inspire solidarity, strength, resilience, and family.

We serve families and individuals. We are folks from different backgrounds in Portland working to build a relationship-based, solidarity network by listening and responding directly to folks' requests and needs. The community members we serve to experience a wide range of hardships that may include but are not limited to: the unexpected death of a loved one, escaping domestic violence, job loss, food Insecurity, houselessness, impacts of Covid, single-parent households, and effects of mental and emotional trauma.

## **Apartment Kit Donation Drive**

### **In Solidarity with our Portland Neighbors**

During the month of April, Solidarity Squad is accepting donations to support our Portland neighbors moving into a new homes. Please donate various kitchen items, bathroom accessories, cleaning supplies, and other new household items.

We partner with The Alano Club of Portland and Fremont United Methodist Church to create drop-off locations for you to drop off items and help us spread healing.

Check out Solidarity Squad’s Target Registry to purchase items directly for our neighbors.
