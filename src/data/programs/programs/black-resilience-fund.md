Black Resilience Fund (BRF) demonstrates the power of hope and action by building community and showing up directly for Black Portlanders. Since its launch on June 1, 2020, BRF has raised over $2.500,000 for Black Portlanders. There are many challenges ahead, shaped by a year of heartache and uncertainty, in addition to generations of unresolved injustice.

Black Resilience Fund is dreaming for a lasting impact in the Portland region. In the face of persistent systemic inequities, they lift up community solutions for **reparations-inspired action**– free from bureaucracy and honoring the vital contributions of our Black communities.

The difference we’ve made in the lives of Black Portlanders gives us hope that **healing is possible.** While Portland is a city with a somber history of discrimination, we are also known as the City of Bridges.

For all of our futures, **let’s make Portland a bridge for racial justice.**
