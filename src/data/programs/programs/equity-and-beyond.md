### **Our Spring 2022 cohort started meeting on March 22nd and we are planning to launch another cohort in August/September.**

For generations, people have fought, bled, and died for freedom, justice, and liberation. We are called to learn from the footsteps of our ancestors, and not let these sacrifices go in vain. A real and human paradise is achievable and will require a living movement that ignites collective consciousness, moral awakening, and sustained action. For that, we need a paradigm shift —for equity, and a vision of justice that’s beyond our single, isolated dreams.

Racism is a societal norm that has been maintained and reinforced for hundreds of generations, preventing all of us, including racially privileged communities, from reaching our potential as a whole, liberated beings. Society’s undisrupted complicity with racism is a snowball rolling into the avalanche that is white supremacy. Equity & Beyond is a powerful space to confront that complicity.

Our learning model uplifts Popular Education—which means that, instead of giving power to a lecturer behind a pulpit, we use interdisciplinary activities, collaborative strategies, emotional vulnerability, and relationship building for a transformational and collective learning experience. Equity & Beyond is a brave space that strives to honor the experiences and contributions of all people while centering the perspectives of those who live with the direct traumas of systemic racism: Black, Brown, and Indigenous folks.

## **Each Equity & Beyond course includes:**

* Facilitated dialogues
* Food
* Experiential, interdisciplinary activities
* Readings and research
* Multimedia materials
* Strategic planning sessions
* Action and reflection
* Fishbowls featuring E&B participants and Black, Brown, and Indigenous guests
