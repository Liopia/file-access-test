    ## Anti-Racism

    All Black, Brown, and Indigenous people are harmed by the disease of white supremacy. We work with a trauma-informed approach, determined to shift culture in a way that undermines institutional racism and the societal complicity that preserves it.

    ## Ancestry

    Our ancestry and our traditions have been stolen from many of us, yet our bond persists. As we continue the work weâ€™ve inherited, we are resolved to create a better future for our unborn generations.

    ## Representation

    We seek self-determination: to define ourselves, and speak for ourselves, and to name what justice is to us. Transformative leadership requires representation from those who are most impacted by injustice.

    ## Collectiveness

    We embrace the diversity of ideas and experiences that make our community. We use consensus in our collective decisionmaking to affirm the value of all participants.

    ## Justice

    We aim to hold others accountable by modeling how we hold ourselves accountable. When faced with injustice, we respond with community interventions that honor the humanity of everyone involved.

    ## Love

    Love nourishes us, reminds us of our humanity, and moves us into action. Our principle of love equips us with an alternative narrative to contrast the fear and greed that drive injustice.

    ## Intersectionality

    We do not live single issue lives. Our work honors the multiple layers of our identities, and centers the experiences of those who live at the intersection of marginalized identities.

    ## Authenticity

    By leading a truthful and transparent movement, we open ourselves up to transformation. Our authenticity grants us the ability to champion truths that cannot be ignored.

    ## Resilience

    Resilient, sustained action is necessary to make justice a lived experience for all. We commit to healing, reflecting, and evolving in preparation for the marathon of justice.

    ## Initiative

    We will not wait for a seat at the table. While the holders of power continue to fail to address injustice, we commit to developing bold strategies and taking initiative.

    ## Access

    In order to access justice, we must build an assertively inclusive movement. We seek to create opportunities for all to participate, across abilities, cultures, languages, and family status.

    ## Abundance

    In our abundant world, there is more than enough for everyone. We reject gradual change as a response to the crisis of global suffering. With the highest expectations of ourselves and others, we offer bold solutions for collective prosperity.
