          We believe that healing is the pathway to justice. We believe that a
          just and healed world will only be possible through a collective sense
          of interdependence, the nurturing of our imaginative spirits, and
          bold, sustained action. Learn more about our mission, vision, and the
          principles that fuel our commitment to racial justice and healing.

          Brown Hope was born on March 16th, 2018 from a deep sense of urgency
          to overcome the vicious cycle of wounding caused by historical and
          ongoing racial trauma.

          Brown Hope responds to racial injustice through healing justice. Our
          theory of change uses a healing justice framework to address the
          cycles of harm perpetuated by historic and ongoing racial trauma, and
          outlines our dream for collective healing.
