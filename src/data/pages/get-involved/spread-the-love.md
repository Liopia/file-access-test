    ## Nominate Someone In Your Life

    Do you know an amazing person who has helped spread love and community and now could use some recognition and love of their own?

    Our #SpreadTheLove campaign is your chance to celebrate the people in our community who continue to make an impact every day by gifting them with one dozen of our vegan Blackstreet Bakery cookies.

    New recipients will be awarded #SpreadTheLove dozen vegan cookies from the Blackstreet Bakery each month.
