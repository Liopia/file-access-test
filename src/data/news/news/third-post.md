In 2011, Cameron Whitten joined the Occupy Wall Street protests in Portland, Oregon. The experience changed their life.

"I knew that I wanted to help others, but I did not think I could do much," Whitten said. "I was a young 20-something with no job, no degree, no driver's license, nothing. I believed that my voice didn't matter."

Before joining the protest, Whitten, who had survived childhood abuse and homelessness while growing up in Virginia, felt they had nothing to live for.

But, after five weeks of marching in Portland, Whitten says they came to realize that every person can make a difference.

"People from all walks of life â€¦ were getting together to speak up and make a difference," Whitten said. "From that, I could tell that my voice did matter, and when I shared my story some people listened, and that empowered other people to take action."

In the aftermath of George Floyd's killing, Whitten co-founded the Black Resilience Fund, a nonprofit that has raised nearly two million dollars to help struggling Black Portlanders.

Floyd's death has brought worldwide attention to the Black Lives Matter movement and social justice. If you're just beginning a journey of learning about racial inequities in America, it's easy to feel like your actions won't make a difference in solving these problems.

"Systems have conditioned us to think that we're helpless, but the truth is our power is rooted in organized money (and) organized people," said Charlene Mack, vice president of movement building at WEPOWER, an organization that addresses systemic issues in education, healthcare, economic opportunity and the justice system for people of color in St. Louis.

You don't have to found a nonprofit or lead a protest to start working towards a better future for all. Here are a variety of ways to start getting involved today.
