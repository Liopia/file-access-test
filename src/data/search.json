Hearing directly from Black voices is one of the best ways to learn about being a good ally.\n\nBe sure to also examine the full extent of your own privilege, and think about ways you can use that privilege for the benefit of others.\n\n## Find your place in the movement\n\n\"We often just see the 10,000-person marches, but we don't see the organizers having 30 one-on-ones a week to help get to that place.
